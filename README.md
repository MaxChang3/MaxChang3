### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Max, an undergraduate student major in philosophy in China. 

I love programing since I was in primary, now I am trying to be admitted to the master of CS/SE. 

I love python and javascript now. :)

Outside of programming, I loving animes and games especially the pixel style like *Celeste* and some independent games "small work" like *Hollow Knight*.

*El Psy Kongroo*
