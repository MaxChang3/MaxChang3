### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am Max, an undergraduate student major in philosophy in China. 

I love programing since I was in primary, now I am trying to be admitted to the master of CS/SE. 

I am unskillful in any programming language, if I have to say, I choose javascript and python.

Outside of programming, I loving animes and games especially the pixel style like *Celeste* and some independent *games* like Hollow Knight.

*El Psy Kongroo*
